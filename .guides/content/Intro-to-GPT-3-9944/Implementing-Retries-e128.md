Generating multiple responses and selecting the most appropriate one can improve the quality and relevance of the AI-generated content. In this guide, we will explore the concept of retries and alternative completions in ChatGPT API interactions, learn how to generate multiple responses, and discuss strategies for selecting the best output for a given context.

We can use the `n` parameter to generate multiple completions for a single user query. The AI will provide `n` different responses, allowing you to choose the most suitable one. In this case we are going to have it print the whole response in order for us to see the output of the `n` value.

```python 
response=openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's a good book to read on a rainy day?"}
    ],
  n=3
)

print(response)

```
{Try It!}(python3 retries.py 1)

We can see under choices now we have 3 different results. Manually review the generated alternatives and choose the response that best answers the user query or aligns with your desired output. The API generates three alternative completions for the user query, providing a range of book suggestions. You can then choose the most fitting response based on your criteria or user preferences.


Implementing retries and alternative completions can enhance the quality and relevance of ChatGPT API-generated content. By generating multiple responses and selecting the best completion, you can ensure the AI provides the most suitable answer for a given context or user query. If you want cleaner results and simply showing the 3 different responses. We can run the following code:
```python
for i in (response["choices"]):
  print(i["message"]['content'].strip()) 
  print(" ////////  ")
```
{Try It!}(python3 retries.py 2)

Here we loop through all the `choices` and retrieve the content inside the messages. We added an extra print statement to differentiate between the responses.
